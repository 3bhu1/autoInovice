# Auto invoice Processing using Optical Character Recognition (Tesseract.js)
Automated Invoice Processing gives you a fully automatic invoice workflow. Automated Invoice Processing software will capture, interpret, validate and transfer the information on your invoices.

Automated invoice processing results in Substantial savings and better control. With manual handling, an invoice costs between $20 to $60 to process.

Automated Invoice Processing software frees you from this manual handling, automates and streamlines your invoice flow, and generates an average savings of 25-50%.
